# Iconec Terms and Conditions for Diamond Jewellery Rentals and Purchases (UAE)

These Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") govern your membership with Iconec and your access to and use of Iconec's services, including the rental and purchase of diamond jewellery (the "Services"). By registering an account, becoming a Member, or otherwise using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Capitalized terms have the meanings set out herein.

---

## Section 1: General Membership, Eligibility, Modifications & Conflicts

Through the Services, Iconec allows members to rent or purchase jewellery. A member is charged a monthly membership fee ("Membership Fee"), in exchange for which he or she can rent a Product or Products for the duration of his or her membership. Iconec offers multiple membership plans or tiers. Your membership plan dictates your Membership Fee and the number of Products you can rent at any one time.

Only adults over the age of 18 may become Members and only Members may rent or purchase Products. Our Products may be rented by a Member for use by other individuals, including individuals under the age of 18; however, the renting Member remains fully responsible for the use of the Products or Services by such individuals, including any legal liability he or she may incur. If you are under 18 years of age, you may only use the Services with the approval of your parent or legal guardian, who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.

Iconec may modify these Terms or modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services at any time for any reason, and without prior notification. Any use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the modified terms. Any new features, tools and/or updates introduced to the service through the Iconec app and/or website will also be governed by these Terms of Service. In the event these Terms conflict with other content and agreements governing your use of the Services, these Terms shall prevail.

---

## Section 2: Account Registration, Security, Membership Waitlist & Discretion

To be a Member and use most aspects of the Services, including renting and/or purchasing Products, you must register for and maintain an active Membership account (an "Account").

Account registration requires you to submit to Iconec certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and date of birth, as well as at least one valid payment method. You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information on your Account. Your failure to do so, including but not limited to having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services, Iconec's termination of this Agreement, the assessment of fees, and/or Iconec's institution of collection procedures.

You are solely responsible and liable for any authorized or unauthorized access to your Account by any person and you agree to maintain the confidentiality of your login information and password. You agree to bear all responsibility for the confidentiality of your account information and all use or charges incurred from the use of the Services with your Account. You agree to notify Iconec promptly of any unauthorized use of your account.

Membership is limited and may not always be available. Registration does not ensure continued membership. Iconec may revoke, cancel, or deny membership at any time and for any reason. If your membership is revoked, cancelled, or denied prior to us ever dispatching a Product to you, you shall receive a full refund of any fees you incurred. Iconec may institute a waitlist ("Waitlist") for aspiring members, and registering for the Waitlist is subject to the same rules and responsibilities as registering for an Account.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or Services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or Services that we offer. All descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at the sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any product or Service made on this site is void where prohibited.

## Section 4: Payment Methods, Card-on-File Authorization & Security Deposit

Upon registration, you must provide a valid payment method, approved by Iconec and our third-party payment processor. Valid payment methods are credit cards that are accepted by our payment processor and that have a credit limit of at least **AED 10,000** for a single user plan and up to **AED 30,000** for a stack user plan, during the entirety of your membership. Prepaid debit or credit cards are not considered valid payment methods.

You hereby authorize Iconec and/or our third-party payment processor to store your payment method details and to place temporary authorization holds and to charge your payment method for all fees set forth in these Terms, including:

- Membership Fees
- Applicable taxes
- Security deposits (where agreed)
- Charges for loss, theft, non-return or damage (including Damaged Beyond Reasonable Wear and Tear)
- Late fees
- Purchase Fees for non-returnable Products

You also authorize Iconec or our third-party payment processor to do a pre-authorization up to **AED 10,000** at any time during your membership, for purposes of confirming the validity of your payment method or addressing Product risk.

### Security Deposit

Members are generally not required to provide a security deposit. However, in rare cases we may require a security deposit as a condition of membership. The required security deposit amount may vary on a case-by-case basis.

If you provide a security deposit, we will refund the entire amount if and when you cancel your membership and return all Products you are renting, so long as said Products are not Damaged Beyond Reasonable Wear and Tear. If your Account is deemed Delinquent (as defined in Section 5), Iconec may keep all or part of your security deposit towards your outstanding balance. If your Account is Delinquent for more than seven days and your outstanding balance exceeds your security deposit, Iconec may institute collection procedures and/or file a police report.

### Billing

Your membership begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your Membership Fee will be charged to your payment method on a recurring basis every 30 days, due on the first day of each 30-day billing period. The Membership Fees include shipping and limited insurance covering minor mishaps and reasonable wear and tear, but not significant damage, loss, or theft. Membership Fees are non-refundable except as expressly stated otherwise. Taxes may apply to Membership Fees.

### Annual Memberships

Iconec may offer Annual Memberships, under which Annual Members pay for 12 months in advance. The annual fees are charged every 360 days and are otherwise subject to the same conditions as monthly membership, including being non-refundable except as expressly stated otherwise. You will be charged at the then-current Membership Fee associated with your Membership Tier. The current Membership Fee associated with each Membership Tier is set out on the Site, but is subject to change at our discretion. You will be given at least one month's notice of any Membership Fee increase for your Membership Tier.

### Purchase Credit

Each Product is available for purchase for its member's price (the "Member's Price" or "Purchase Fee"), which can be viewed on the Product page; taxes may apply. For each month that you are a Member, and regardless of your membership tier, amounts you pay toward Membership Fees accrue as non-cash credit to your Account ("Purchase Credit").

Purchase Credit:

- May be applied only toward the Purchase Fee for Products from Iconec at the Member's Price
- Is non-transferable
- Has no cash value
- May not be redeemed for cash or used to set off any amounts other than a Product's Purchase Fee
- Will expire and reset upon cancellation of your Membership unless otherwise required by applicable law

---

## Section 5: Modifications to the Service and Prices

Prices for our products are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time. We shall not be liable to you for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

---

## Section 6: Membership Tier Changes, Non-Returnable Products, Charge Rights, Delinquency & Collections

### Tier Changes

You may request upgrades and downgrades through the Iconec App. We will usually process upgrade requests within 1–3 business days.

- **Upgrades:** You will be charged the difference between your previous Membership Fee and your new Membership Fee, prorated based on the number of days left in your 30-day billing period, which will be added to your next monthly charge.
- **Downgrades:** The downgrade will take effect for the subsequent 30-day billing period after we receive all Product(s) in excess of the allowance under your requested tier; no credit will be provided for remaining days in the then-current period. If you fail by the end of your next billing cycle to return excess Product(s), your downgrade request will be withdrawn.

### Non-Returnable Products

If you are unable to return a Product because it is lost, stolen or destroyed (unless it falls under shipping exceptions below), or if you return any Product that is Damaged Beyond Reasonable Wear and Tear (as defined in Section 7), you are liable for that Product's Purchase Fee and you authorize Iconec to charge your payment method for that Purchase Fee. If you are charged a Product's Purchase Fee for a Product that is non-returnable, you are entitled to ownership of that Product.

### Shipping Exceptions

If a Product is lost or damaged while it is in the custody of the shipping provider, you are not liable for that Product:

- **Outgoing Products** are in the shipping provider's custody unless and until documented as delivered to your address on file.
- **Incoming Products** are in the shipping provider's custody only after documented as having been received by the shipping provider.

If you attempt to return a Product using a method or label not approved by Iconec, you are liable for loss or damage.

### Purchase Fee Due Dates

- **Lost, stolen, irretrievable, or destroyed Products:** Purchase Fee is due on the last day of your membership.
- **Damaged Products:** Purchase Fee is due on the last day of your membership or the day we receive the damaged Product, whichever is sooner.

### Direct Purchases

All products purchased directly through the Iconec app or by submitting an order request via customer care are deemed **final sale**. Accordingly, such purchases are not eligible for return, exchange, or refund under any circumstances.

### Delinquency & Collections

If a Membership Fee is due and the payment method on your Account cannot be charged for the entire amount due, the Purchase Fee(s) for any Product(s) not yet received by us are automatically and immediately due. You authorize Iconec to charge or attempt to charge your payment method at any time on and/or after the day any fees are due.

An account is **"Delinquent"** if, on the due date of any fee (including Membership Fees and any Purchase Fees):

- There is no valid payment method on file, **or**
- Any undisputed amount remains unpaid in full

An account remains Delinquent until all such amounts are paid and a valid payment method is restored. While an Account is Delinquent, Iconec may suspend shipments and Services.

If your account is Delinquent for **7 or more days**, Iconec may:

- Institute collection procedures and use or share with third-party collection agencies any information on file (including personal and billing information) to recover outstanding fees
- File a police report and take actions it deems reasonably necessary to collect outstanding debt

You agree to pay Iconec's costs of collection including reasonable attorneys' fees.

If Iconec cancels your Account for any reason, you must return all Products immediately. If Iconec has not received your Products within **seven business days** after notifying you that your Account has been cancelled, you will be liable for the Purchase Fee for all Products not received by that date. Iconec retains sole discretion to delay, waive, or refund a Purchase Fee for a Delinquent (or previously Delinquent) Account.

---

## Section 7: Rental Period, Care, Authenticity & Variations

Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including payment of fees) and our right to terminate the Services, you will have **30 days** with the Product sent to you through Iconec. We clean, sterilize and inspect each Product we send to you, but use of the Products is at your own risk and Iconec shall not be held liable for any health-related complaints associated with Products.

You will treat all Products you rent from Iconec with great care and are responsible for all loss of, or destruction or damage to, any Product due to theft, mysterious disappearance, fire, or any other cause, other than normal wear and tear, including alterations made without Iconec's authorization and disregard for reasonable care required for a specific Product.

### Damaged Beyond Reasonable Wear and Tear

"Damaged Beyond Reasonable Wear and Tear" means damage that exceeds minor, cosmetic signs of ordinary use and that materially impairs the condition, function, safety, or value of a Product.

**Reasonable wear and tear includes:**

- Light surface marks
- Minor tarnish removable by standard cleaning

**Damaged Beyond Reasonable Wear and Tear includes, without limitation:**

- Chipped, cracked, or missing stones
- Bent, broken, or deformed settings, clasps, chains, or posts
- Deep scratches or gouges
- Evidence of exposure to harsh chemicals or heat
- Water or impact damage
- Unauthorized repairs, sizing, engraving, or modifications
- Any other condition that requires professional repair or renders the Product unfit for rental without refurbishment

Iconec will make determinations in good faith in accordance with commercially reasonable standards and may rely on photographs, inspections, and third-party assessments.

### Authenticity & Variations

Iconec goes to great lengths to ensure that all products are authentic. Unless noted otherwise, the brands sold on the Site are not partnered or affiliated with Iconec in any manner. Iconec fully cooperates with brands seeking to track down the source of counterfeit items. Products may differ in person from descriptions or images, may exhibit more wear in person than shown online, and may change in colour or appearance over time.

---

## Section 8: Shipping, Delivery, Returns & Exchanges

All deliveries will be through Iconec's shipping partners, which may change from time to time at our discretion. The shipping method used will be at Iconec's discretion. You bear responsibility for items that are delivered to your address and acknowledge that shipping to an address where an individual can physically receive the item is required. If you are not present to physically receive a Product, you agree to bear all liability for loss, theft, or disappearance of a Product left unattended.

### Returns

You must return at least one Product to be eligible to receive another Product. With delivery of Product(s) to you, Iconec will schedule the return pick-up through the Iconec App and Iconec-branded boxes that contain the Product ("Product Box"). The Product Boxes are not yours to keep.

When you are ready to return any Products:

- Place them in the Product Boxes in which you received them
- Upon our delivery team's receipt, your next delivery will consist of the number of Products that you have returned
- Products must be returned in the Product Boxes to our delivery team
- Any measures used to secure the Products when sent to you (such as padding) should be used in the return packaging
- Products should be sent back in the original packaging, including bags or pouches that contained individual Product(s)
- If original packaging has been lost or damaged, you may use alternate packaging so long as it is sufficiently secure and confirmed as acceptable with our shipping partner

If you send Products with a shipping method other than Iconec's delivery team, you bear all costs and liabilities associated with shipping and shipment of subsequent Products by Iconec may be delayed.

---

## Section 9: Cancellation

To cancel your Membership, you may do so on the Iconec App and must return all Iconec Products in your possession. Your cancellation does not take effect until:

1. You inform Iconec that you want to cancel, **and**
2. We have received all Product(s) you have been renting

You must return your Iconec Products before the end of the billing period in which you want to cancel to avoid a Membership Fee for the subsequent billing period. If Iconec does not receive all of our Products by the end of that billing period, Iconec will charge you a Membership Fee for the subsequent billing period and your membership will remain in effect until we receive all of our Products.

Any violation of these Terms may result in suspension or termination of your membership and/or access to the Services. Iconec may terminate your account if it determines that your conduct poses a risk or liability to Iconec, or for any other reason in Iconec's sole discretion.

If we cancel the Services or your Membership for reasons other than your conduct or violation of these Terms, we will give you a prorated refund for the remainder of your subscription period so long as all Products are received by us within **10 days** of informing you of said cancellation.

Upon cancellation, you must return all Products and remain responsible for all fees including outstanding Membership Fees and Purchase Fees.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations. Iconec may assign these Terms at any time without notice to you.

---

## Section 15: No Waiver & Survival

The failure of a party to require performance of any provision will not affect such party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

Any provisions that by their nature should survive termination or cancellation shall so survive, including but not limited to fee obligations, dispute resolution, limitation of liability, indemnity, intellectual property, and governing law.
